# Workout-Creator

## Description
Welcome to Booty Camp! With our fitness app, you are going to maximize your performace. With our app, you can freely choose between the work outs you want to do, and our app gives out demo videos to show you the correct way to perform workout routines. 

Our group chose this project because we have passions in fitness and care about our health. It also allowed us to practice coding as a team and repo management.  By the end, our coding, problem solving, git-use, and teamwork skills all were improved by the experience.
